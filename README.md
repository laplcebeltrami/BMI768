# BMI/STAT 768

2025 Spring Semester

Days & Times: M/W 9:30-10:45am 

Room: Grainger 2180

Duration: January 21, 2025 - May 2, 2025



## Instructor
Moo K. Chung, mkchung@wisc.edu

University of Wiconsin-Madison

Office: Medical Science Center 4725, 1300 University Ave

Office Hours: M/W 10:45am-12:00pm. Since MSC is too far from the lecture hall, I will hold the officee hour in the class room after each class. 
To set up separate Zoom appointments, please email the instructor. 


## Prerequisite
The course is designed for graduate students who wish to learn quantitative mathematical, statistical and computational techniques in processing and analyzing medical images. The basic understanding of linear algebra, calculus and statistics will be useful to fully understand lectures. The course material is applicable to a wide variety of high dimensional nonstandard data and imaging problems beyond medical images. 



## ðŸ”´ Topics

MATLAB programming: Image computation, online & scalable algorithms, optimizations

Data visualization using MATLAB: manifold data, network and graph data, scientific animation

Statitical Models: Inference, clustering and classification

Time series analysis: Biomedical signals, autoregressive models, least squares estimation in time series, granger causality

Functional Data Analysis (FDA): Hilbert space theory, basis function methods, differential equations, regression with basis functions

Geometric Data Analysis (GDA): Riemannian geometry, Jacobain determinant vs. metric tensor, manifold learning, 
regression on manifolds, spectral geometry, spectral clustering

Topological Data Analysis (TDA): persistent homology, persistence diagrams, barcodes, topolgoical distance, topological clustering

Network Data Analysis (NDA): Trees, graphs, networks, Hodge Laplacian and decomposition, network data visualization


## ðŸ”´ Outline

Linear equations, least squares estimation, matrix exponential, diffusion - 3 weeks

Time series data, clustering, state space stimation, time frequency analysis, autoregressive model, Granger causality - 3 weeks

Topological data analysis, topological distance, topological clustering, persitence diagrams, Hodge Laplacian - 3 weeks


## Textbooks

There is no required textbook. Lecture slides, additional notes, computer codes will be provided before each lecture through github. Each lecture will accompany detailed computer demonstration showing how each method works. Parts of lectures will be based on the following three text books written by the instructor:

Computational Neuroanatomy: The Methods, 2012 World Scientific Publishing

Statistical and Computational Methods in Brain Image Analsis, 2013 CRC Press

Brain Network Analysis, 2019 Cambridge University Press


## Course evaluation 

The course evalution is based on the final project report. Students are required submit the final research project report.
Optional oral presentation on the project can be done through the class. The project can be 

1) literature review or method survey on topics we discussed in class,

2) computer programming project,
  
3) detailed solution to specific problems dicussed in class, or

4) research project. Well written sample class projects in previous image analysis course taught by the instructor can be found here: https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~mchung/teaching/MIA/projects/. Each semester, the focus of the course change slightly. So the sample project reports may not reflect the current course topics. 

ðŸ”´ For students new to the field, you do not require to prepare for your own medical imaging data for the project report. The state of art medical imaging data sets will be freely available through the class. About 5 different types data (2D and 3D images, surface mesh data, network data, time series data) will be available. If you want to use your own data, consult with the instructor.
