## 🔴  Instructor
Moo K. Chung, mkchung@wisc.edu

University of Wisconsin-Madison

Office: Morgridge Hall 6536, 1205 University Ave, Madison WI 53706

Office Hours: M/W 10:45am-12:00pm. To set up separate Zoom appointments, please email the instructor. 


## 🔴  Prerequisite
The course is designed for graduate students who wish to learn quantitative mathematical, statistical and computational techniques in processing and analyzing medical images. The basic understanding of linear algebra, calculus and statistics will be useful to fully understand lectures. The course material is applicable to a wide variety of high dimensional nonstandard data and imaging problems beyond medical images. 



## 🔴 Topics

MATLAB programming: Image computation, online & scalable algorithms, optimization

Scientific visualization using MATLAB: manifold data, network and graph data, scientific animation

Statistical Analysis: Inference, p-values, statistical significance, hierarchical models (mixed-effects models), clustering and classification

Time series Analysis: Biomedical signals, autoregressive models, Granger causality

Functional Data Analysis (FDA): Hilbert space methods, basis function methods, differential equations, regression with basis functions

Geometric Data Analysis (GDA): Riemannian geometry, regression on manifolds, spectral geometry, spectral clustering

Topological Data Analysis (TDA): persistent homology, persistence diagrams, barcodes, topological distance, topological clustering, topological avearging

Network Data Analysis (NDA): Trees, graphs, networks, Hodge Laplacian and decomposition, network data visualization, network as time-varying objects. 


## 🔴 Outline

## 🔴 Textbooks

There is no required textbook. Lecture slides, additional notes, computer codes, and few video lectures will be provided before each lecture through github. Each lecture will accompany detailed computer demonstration showing how each method works. Majority of lecture materials will be based on the following three text books written by the instructor:

Computational Neuroanatomy: The Methods, 2012 World Scientific Publishing

Statistical and Computational Methods in Brain Image Analysis, 2013 CRC Press

Brain Network Analysis, 2019 Cambridge University Press


## 🔴  Course evaluation 

The course evaluation is based on the final project report related activities (10% on Oral Research Proposal, 70% on Written Final Research Report, 20% Fianal Oral Research Presentation). The project must be based on class materials and students will have choices to choose out of about 20 possible project problems covered in class. The publication-quality state-of-art data and Images for the project will be provided by the intuctor. 


Well written sample class projects in previous image analysis course taught by the instructor can be found here:

Each semester, the focus of the course change slightly. So, the sample project reports may not reflect the current course topics.
