2025 Spring Semester

Days & Times: M/W 9:30-10:45am 
Room: Grainger 2180
Duration: January 21, 2025 - May 2, 2025


## Instructor
Moo K. Chung, mkchung@wisc.edu
University of Wiconsin-Madison

Office: Medical Science Center 4725, 1300 University Ave

Office Hours: M/W 10:45am-12:30pm, To set up separate Zoom appointments, please email the instructor. 


## Prerequisite
The course is designed for graduate students who wish to learn quantitative mathematical, statistical and computational techniques in processing and analyzing medical images. The basic understanding of linear algebra, calculus and statistics will be useful to fully understand lectures. The course material is applicable to a wide variety of high dimensional nonstandard data and imaging problems beyond medical images. 



## Topics

MATLAB programming: Image computation, online & scalable algorithms, optimizations

Statitical Models: Inference, clusstering and classification

Functional Data Analysis (FDA): Hilbert space theory, basis function methods, differential equations, regression

Geometric Data Analysis (GDA): Riemannian geometry, spectral geometry, manifold learning, regression on manifolds, spectral clustering

Topological Data Analysis (TDA): Simplical homology, persistent homology, algebraic topology, topological clustering

Network Data Analysis (NDA): Trees, graphs, networks


## Textbooks

There is no required textbook. Lecture slides, additional notes, computer codes will be provided before each lecture through github. Each lecture will accompany detailed computer demonstration showing how each methods works. Parts of lectures will be based on the following three text books written by the instructor:

Computational Neuroanatomy: The Methods, 2012 World Scientific Publishing
Statistical and Computational Methods in Brain Image Analsis, 2013 CRC Press
Brain Network Analysis, 2019 Cambridge University Press
