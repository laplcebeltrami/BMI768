## 🔴  Prerequisite
The course is designed for graduate students who wish to learn quantitative mathematical, statistical and computational techniques in processing and analyzing medical images. The basic understanding of linear algebra, calculus and statistics will be useful to fully understand lectures. The course material is applicable to a wide variety of high dimensional nonstandard data and imaging problems beyond medical images. 



## 🔴 Topics

MATLAB programming: Image computation, online & scalable algorithms, optimization

Scientific visualization using MATLAB: manifold data, network and graph data, scientific animation

Statistical Analysis: Inference, p-values, statistical significance, hierarchical models (mixed-effects models), clustering and classification

Time series Analysis: Biomedical signals, autoregressive models, Granger causality

Functional Data Analysis (FDA): Hilbert space methods, basis function methods, differential equations, regression with basis functions

Geometric Data Analysis (GDA): Riemannian geometry, regression on manifolds, spectral geometry, spectral clustering

Topological Data Analysis (TDA): persistent homology, persistence diagrams, barcodes, topological distance, topological clustering, topological avearging

Network Data Analysis (NDA): Trees, graphs, networks, Hodge Laplacian and decomposition, network data visualization, network as time-varying objects.

## 🔴 Textbooks

There is no required textbook. Lecture slides, additional notes, computer codes, and few video lectures will be provided before each lecture through github. Each lecture will accompany detailed computer demonstration showing how each method works. Majority of lecture materials will be based on the following three text books written by the instructor:

Computational Neuroanatomy: The Methods, 2012 World Scientific Publishing

Statistical and Computational Methods in Brain Image Analysis, 2013 CRC Press

Brain Network Analysis, 2019 Cambridge University Press


## 🔴  Course evaluation 

The course evaluation is entirely project-based, emphasizing hands-on research and scholarly communication, with required one-to-one interaction between each student and the instructor throughout the semester. Assessment consists of an Oral Research Proposal (10%), a Written Final Research Report (60%), a Final Oral Research Presentation (20%), and Research Engagement and Progress (10%). Projects are grounded in course materials, with students selecting from approximately 20 instructor-curated research problems that reflect state-of-the-art methods covered in class. To lower the barrier to entry and allow students to focus on modeling, analysis, and interpretation rather than data acquisition, publication-quality, state-of-the-art datasets and images are provided by the instructor. The course is designed to support students seeking structured exposure to research or conducting research for the first time through clearly defined milestones, iterative feedback, and close one-to-one mentorship. By the end of the course, students complete a research project approaching publication quality, gaining practical experience in formulating research questions, executing state-of-the-art data analytical methods, and communicating results at a professional level.

Well written sample class projects in previous image analysis course taught by the instructor can be found here:

Each semester, the focus of the course change slightly. So, the sample project reports may not reflect the current course topics.  


## 🔴 Acknowledgment

The development of some course materials (Hodge Laplacian and various brain network analysis modules) was partially supported by NSF Award 2010778. This support has had a direct and sustained impact on teaching and educational experiences through continuous integration of the developed methods from the project into graduate-level instruction. The course provides a unique testbed for deploying the proposed methods and accompanying software with advanced student users, enabling iterative refinement informed by real-world use and feedback.
