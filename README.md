## 🔴  Prerequisite
This course is designed for graduate students interested in learning quantitative mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques for processing and analyzing medical images. A basic understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and statistics is recommended to fully engage with the lectures. Prior exposure to computer programming is assumed. While the course emphasizes medical imaging, the material is broadly applicable to a wide range of high-dimensional, nonstandard data analysis problems beyond imaging.


## 🔴 Topics

MATLAB programming: Image computation, online & scalable algorithms, optimization

Scientific visualization using MATLAB: manifold data, network and graph data, scientific animation

Statistical Analysis: Inference, p-values, statistical significance, hierarchical models (mixed-effects models), clustering and classification

Time series Analysis: Biomedical signals, autoregressive models, Granger causality

Functional Data Analysis (FDA): Hilbert space methods, basis function methods, differential equations, regression with basis functions

Geometric Data Analysis (GDA): Riemannian geometry, regression on manifolds, spectral geometry, spectral clustering

Topological Data Analysis (TDA): persistent homology, persistence diagrams, barcodes, topological distance, topological clustering, topological avearging

Network Data Analysis (NDA): Trees, graphs, networks, Hodge Laplacian and decomposition, network data visualization, network as time-varying objects.

## 🔴 Textbooks

There is no required textbook. Lecture slides, additional notes, computer codes, and few video lectures will be provided before each lecture through github. Each lecture will accompany detailed computer demonstration showing how each method works. Majority of lecture materials will be based on the following three text books written by the instructor:

Computational Neuroanatomy: The Methods, 2012 World Scientific Publishing

Statistical and Computational Methods in Brain Image Analysis, 2013 CRC Press

Brain Network Analysis, 2019 Cambridge University Press

For TDA, we will use Chung, M.K. 2025 PH-STAT, [arXiv:2304.0591](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05912).


## 🔴  Course evaluation 

The course evaluation is based on Final Project Report Related Activity. Assessment consists of an Oral Research Proposal (10%), a Written Final Research Report (60%), a Final Oral Research Presentation (20%), and Research Engagement and Progress (10%). Projects are grounded in course materials, with students selecting from approximately 20-30 instructor-curated research problems covered in class. To lower the barrier to entry and allow students to focus on conceptual understanding, modeling, analysis, and interpretation rather than data acquisition, publication-quality datasets and images are provided by the instructor. The course is designed to support students seeking structured exposure to research or conducting research for the first time, through clearly defined milestones and iterative feedback. By the end of the course, students complete a research project that emphasizes methodological soundness, reproducibility, and professional scientific communication.

Well written sample class projects in previous image analysis courses taught by the instructor can be found [here](https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/BMI768/tree/main/samplereports). Students usually come from diverse backgrounds: undergraduates, engineering, statistics, CS, psychology, biology, neuroscience and medicine. Each semester, the focus of the course change slightly. So, the sample project reports may not reflect the current semester.  


## 🔴 Acknowledgment

The development of some course materials (Hodge Laplacian and various brain network analysis modules) was partially supported by NSF Award 2010778. This support has had a direct and sustained impact on teaching and educational experiences through continuous integration of the developed methods from the project into graduate-level instruction. The course provides a unique testbed for deploying the proposed methods and accompanying software with advanced student users, enabling iterative refinement informed by real-world use and feedback.
