Office: Medical Science Center 4725, 1300 University Ave

Office Hours: M/W 10:45am-12:30pm, To set up separate Zoom appointments, please email the instructor. 


## Prerequisite
The course is designed for graduate students who wish to learn quantitative mathematical, statistical and computational techniques in processing and analyzing medical images. The basic understanding of linear algebra, calculus and statistics will be useful to fully understand lectures. The course material is applicable to a wide variety of high dimensional nonstandard data and imaging problems beyond medical images. 

## Topics

Image computation
MATLAB programming, online & scalable algorithms, optimizations

Functional Data Analysis (FDA)

Hilbert space theory, basis function methods, differential equations, regression

Geometric Data Analysis (GDA)

Riemannian geometry, spectral geometry, manifold learning, regression on manifolds, spectral clustering

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) 

Simplical homology, persistent homology, algebraic topology, topological clustering

Network Data Analysis (NDA)
 Trees, graphs, networks




## Time Series Data
Cmtx = sliding_window(Cmtx, windowSize);
Error using zeros
Requested 11651x11651x1173 (1186.4GB) array exceeds maximum array size
preference (48.0GB). This might cause MATLAB to become unresponsive.
